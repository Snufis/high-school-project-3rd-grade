# Project Assignment: Student Performance Data Analysis

Part I — Data Loading and Basic Exploration
-------------------------------------------
1. Load the dataset using pd.read_csv().
2. Display the first and last rows of the table.
3. Show column names and data types.
4. Display descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, variance,
   standard deviation, min, max).
5. Use the pandas function that prints technical summary info (count, unique, etc.).
6. Check the dataset for missing values.

Part II — Data Selection and Transformation
-------------------------------------------
1. Display a single column (e.g., math score).
2. Display two or three selected columns at once.
3. Show only students with math scores > 90.
4. Show only female students with reading scores > 70.
5. Add a column containing each student's average score across the three subjects.
6. Add a helper column indicating whether the math score is above the overall mean.

Part III — GroupBy Analysis
---------------------------
1. Compare average math scores between male and female students.
2. Check whether students who completed the test preparation course achieved
   higher average scores than those who did not.

Part IV — Data Visualization
----------------------------
Create the following plots (with axis labels, titles, and colors where useful):
1. Histogram of reading scores.
2. Boxplot comparing the three subjects.
3. Bar chart comparing average scores by:
   - gender
   - lunch type
   - parental education level
   - test preparation course completion
4. Scatter plot showing the relationship between math and reading scores.

Part V — Summary and Conclusions
--------------------------------
Prepare a short summary addressing:
1. Which student groups achieve higher average scores?
2. Does participation in the preparation course affect performance?
3. What are the two or three key insights from the analysis?
